That's why we protect your data from leakage, protect forests from destruction, protect children from malnutrition and protect girls from unsafe menstruation periods. We love protection and everything we do is protection-based.",
        "description2": "This privacy policy by the Ssebowa search engine explains our stance on personal information concerning cookies, tracking, logging, data usage, contact information and any links to third parties. Please read it thoroughly."

        "description1": "We are a non-profit organization that cares about tree planting, feeding hungry children and giving sanitary pads to girls without pads. We have committed ourselves to free access to information since we know that free research is not compatible with mass surveillance. We also take privacy very seriously and only process the data that is necessary for the operation of our services. Data protection is always the standard we aim for and we do not create any kind of profiles."

        "title": "How Ssebowa protects your privacy",
        "description1": "As a search engine, our top priority is to provide our users with a safe and private online search experience. We recognize that many websites use tracking scripts and other types of web-based surveillance to collect data about their users, which can compromise user privacy and security. To mitigate this risk, we have implemented the declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess feature in our Chrome extension.",
        "description2": "With this feature, we can block or modify certain network requests before they are sent to their destination, ensuring that sensitive information is not shared with third parties without the user's consent. For example, we can block requests to known tracking domains or modify requests to remove tracking parameters from URLs.",
        "description3": "This feature not only protects our users' privacy and security but also improves their search experience by reducing the amount of irrelevant or unwanted content that they may encounter while browsing the web."

        "description1": "When using our web search engine Ssebowa, some needed data is collected but with a self-hosted, secure and encrypted in-built analytics system. The following is the data generated:"

        "title": "Internet protocol address",
        "description1": "The Internet protocol address commonly referred to as IP is necessary to use web services like Ssebowa. This IP, in combination with digits similar to a telephone number, uniquely identifies Internet access and its owner.",
        "description2": "For all data collected using the IP address, we take many serious steps to ensure that it is safe and anonymous. For instance,  we remove parts of the IP address when we store it to make it anonymous. For example, 172.198.256.413 is turned into 172.198.XXX.XXX.",
        "description3": "If a noticeable number of searches are performed by an IP, this IP is temporarily stored after the last search but only kept for a maximum of 5 days. After 5 days, the IP is permanently deleted."

        "title": "What does Ssebowa do with it?",
        "description1": "At Ssebowa, we want to make sure our users have the best and safe search experience possible. We collect data and do statistical analysis to understand user behaviour and trends, know how people use our services, monitor and troubleshoot as well as improve Ssebowa. For instance, we might use it to decide which new feature to build next.",
        "description2": "For this, we use a self-hosted, secure and encrypted in-built analytics system. This allows us to obtain data about our users' interaction with Ssebowa services and products in a secure and anonymized way.",
        "description3": "We also save the searches we receive to filter spam. Unfortunately, there are a lot of spam search requests and this allows us to block them. If we would not block spam it would cost us money and resources to answer these search requests, meaning that we would not effectively carry out charitable activities of tree planting, feeding hungry children and giving sanitary pads to girls without pads.",
        "description4": "After 5 days we remove all personal information like the IP address from the search data. By doing this, we 100% make sure that we have no way of knowing who searched, and what was searched for and do not connect different searches or operate profiling i.e. the automatic creation of user profiles.",
        "description5": "Furthermore, we collect anonymous data to help identify and debug issues in Ssebowa services and products. For example, this data includes log data collected by our servers or data related to program crashes and exceptions."

        "description1": "A cookie is a small text file sent by a website you visit on your device. Ssebowa uses cookies to remember your technical preferences like language so that on the same device these preferences stay the same from one search to another and ensure that you get the best experience on our website. All this is done with much due respect for your privacy because the cookies used do not contain information that would personally identify you and are not accessible to third parties. Henceforth, we do not merge any cookies or other tracking technologies provided by advertising agencies or other partners."

        "description1": "After 5 days we remove all personal information like the IP address from the search data we collect ourselves. So we don't know what you have searched for.",
        "description2": "We will never share your searches with anyone. Not even any search results provider will have access to it because we use our crawlers to directly answer your search requests. To ensure this, we don't use any third-party tools on the Ssebowa Search pages and actively prevent Search Leakage by default. Instead, when you click on a link on our site, we redirect that request in such a way that it does not send your search terms to other sites. So none of the sites you visit by clicking on a search result on Ssebowa know what you searched for. Please be aware that we canâ€™t influence what third-party websites track about you once you have followed a link."

        "description1": "Just like any other search engine, we do display search ads next to the search results. When users click on these ads we earn income through ad revenue which we use for tree planting, feeding hungry children and giving sanitary pads to teenage girls. We can display these advertisements while still being privacy friendly.",
        "description2": "We work with ad networks to show ads based on your search query. When you do a search and ads are displayed next to the search results no data is collected or shared with the advertiser."

        "description1": "Ssebowa does its best to protect your privacy while you search, but you can take additional steps to protect your internet browsing from other parties. For example, your network provider or browser might still be able to access some of your data. If you feel insecure searching for information because you think you might be tracked, we would recommend you use a service such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or TOR relay service so that even Ssebowa does not have access to your real IP address. ",
        "description2": "We also advise you to use the Ssebowa app for your internet browsing or other browsers that do not keep your browsing history and do not analyze it for advertising purposes."
